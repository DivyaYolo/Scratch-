ðŸ‘ŒComputer Science is not all about Programming and Working in isolation.

ðŸ‘ŒIt's really about problem solving more generally.

ðŸ‘Œ-What is Computer Scince?

So I want the computer to do something PRECISE,PERFECT AND LOGICAL so obviously I need to think PRECISE,PERFECT AND METHODICAL to make the computer to do that for me. Then COmputer is not going to do it precise If I'm not.

ðŸ‘Œ-problem solving

INPUT - > â¬œ - > OUTPUT

ðŸ‘Œ-REPRESNET ðŸ˜Ž, SO HOW TO REPRESENT?

computers speak only one language = "Binary (0,1)"

000 - 0

001 - 1

010 - 2

011 - 3

100 - 4

101 - 5

110 - 6

111 - 7

after all it's just electricity and only has 0 or 1 , on or off, true or false.(transistors)

want to count more than 7, add a bit

0000

-How to represent letters in binary?

ASCII - AMERICAN STANDARD CODE FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE

A = 65

Z = 90

a = 97 

z = 122

Unicode - superset of ASCII, MAPPING OF MANY MORE NUMBERS TO MANY MORE LETTERS OR CHARACTERS - USE 16bits or 32bits.

- it helps make colours
- emojis
- pixels
- video is a sequence of images in the matter of time
- MIDI - SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS FOR music
- MP4s or documents.
- 
--------These are the list of ways a computer represents information--------
  
ðŸ‘ŒCompression 

lossy compression - minimizing 0s and 1s in a way that a photo or video is stored at a  less amount but loses some bits or bytes

lossless compression - minimizing 0s and 1s without any deletion or removal of the picture quality or pixelation or anything.

ALGORITHM - Step by step instructions for solving algorithm

INPUT - > â¬œ - > OUTPUT

â¬œ - > Inputs go inside and outputs coming out of it, what it actually holds is the ALGORITHM

No matter what the programming language we use for an algoritm or set of instructions, the computer is just going to represent what we have typed in 0s and 1s

EXAMPLE = a telephone directory book - consider divide and conquer method - an algorithm.

Basically programming is not all about learning a new world, it's a way of harnessing ideas,intuition that we have and learning to express them in programming languages.

PSEUDOCODE - SIMPLE INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH - TO EXPRESS OURSELVES BETTER.

PSEUDOCODE FOR PSEUDOCODE:

STEP 1: Pick up the phone book

STEP 2: Go to middle page of the phonebook

STEP 3: Look at the pages

STEP 4: if you found John Harvard

            CALL HIM
            
STEP 5: else if person is earlier in the phonebook

            Go left
            
            repeat step 3
            
STEP 6: else if person is later in the phonebook

            Go right
            
            repeat step 3
            
STEP 7: else:

            EXIT - aka very important step beacause it's the reason a program might crash.

ðŸ‘ŒComputer Science is not all about Programming and Working in isolation.
ðŸ‘ŒIt's really about problem solving more generally.

ðŸ‘Œ-What is Computer Scince?
So I want the computer to do something PRECISE,PERFECT AND LOGICAL so obviously I need to think PRECISE,PERFECT AND METHODICAL to make the computer to do that for me. Then COmputer is not going to do it precise If I'm not.

ðŸ‘Œ-problem solving
INPUT - > â¬œ - > OUTPUT

ðŸ‘Œ-REPRESNET ðŸ˜Ž, SO HOW TO REPRESENT?
computers speak only one language = "Binary (0,1)"
000 - 0
001 - 1
010 - 2
011 - 3
100 - 4
101 - 5
110 - 6
111 - 7
after all it's just electricity and only has 0 or 1 , on or off, true or false.(transistors)
want to count more than 7, add a bit
0000
-How to represent letters in binary?
ASCII - AMERICAN STANDARD CODE FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE
A = 65
Z = 90
a = 97 
z = 122

Unicode - superset of ASCII, MAPPING OF MANY MORE NUMBERS TO MANY MORE LETTERS OR CHARACTERS - USE 16bits or 32bits.
- it helps make colours
- emojis
- pixels
- video is a sequence of images in the matter of time
- MIDI - SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS FOR music
--------These are the list of ways a computer represents information--------
ðŸ‘ŒCompression 
lossy compression - minimizing 0s and 1s in a way that a photo or video is stored at a  less amount but loses some bits or bytes
lossless compression - minimizing 0s and 1s without any deletion or removal of the picture quality or pixelation or anything.
